# 3D printer Network Manager - WEB

## Inspiration

We've decided to build this project because nowadays 3d printing is beeing more popular and the industry demands more people working on it

## What it does

It allows you to manage a whole network of 3D printers using the web interface with live statistics of all the machines allowing you to mass-produce 3D models.

## How we built it

We built it using diferent showftware such as: Python, PHP, Javascript, C#, HTML, CSS, MySQL, etc

## Challenges we ran into

We had lots of trouble dedicating hours to avoid using sequential codes and just run into a full working one. Now It's actually pretty stable so we're proud of it!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The whole thing is for as a huge reward, we built a nice showftware with a nice hardware as well.

## What we learned

Lots of project leading and project management as well as developing new skills for 

## What's next for 3D Printer Network Manager
We would be very happy to continue developing it since it can be much better by adding lots of modules and stuff!
